Making app:
--web app is fully responsive, Laptop screen/Pad screen/ Mobile screen.
--Flavour of SCSS/Styled Component/ Material UI.
--I have used ReactJs to develop app because it was original requirement and react is giving Single Page Application facility, so performance of site is quick responsive and fast.
--For clear code and future requirements of reusable component, I have used component methodology so in future if requirements go bigger, developer can handle very easily and understands where to change.
Also used react-router to route the page. As per requirements app has three pages with routing facility.
